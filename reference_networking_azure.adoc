You must set up your Azure networking so Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems can operate properly.

****
Looking for the list of endpoints to which Cloud Manager requires access? They're now maintained in a single location. link:reference_networking_cloud_manager.html[Click here for details].
****

Outbound internet access for Cloud Volumes ONTAP::
Cloud Volumes ONTAP requires outbound internet access to send messages to NetApp AutoSupport, which proactively monitors the health of your storage.
+
Routing and firewall policies must allow AWS HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the following endpoints so Cloud Volumes ONTAP can send AutoSupport messages:
+
* \https://support.netapp.com/aods/asupmessage
* support.netapp.com/asupprod/post/1.0/postAsup

Security groups::
You do not need to create security groups because Cloud Manager does that for you. If you need to use your own, refer to link:reference_security_groups_azure.html[Security group rules].

Connection from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to Azure Blob storage for data tiering::
If you want to tier cold data to Azure Blob storage, you do not need to set up a VNet service endpoint as long as Cloud Manager has the required permissions:
+
[source,json]
"Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/write",
"Microsoft.Network/routeTables/join/action",
+
These permissions are included in the latest https://mysupport.netapp.com/cloudontap/iampolicies[Cloud Manager policy].
+
For details about setting up data tiering, see link:task_tiering.html[Tiering cold data to low-cost object storage].

Connections to ONTAP systems in other networks::
To replicate data between a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in Azure and ONTAP systems in other networks, you must have a VPN connection between the Azure VNet and the other networkâ€”for example, an AWS VPC or your corporate network.
