Understanding how Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses cloud storage can help you understand your storage costs.

== Overview

Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses AWS and Azure volumes as back-end storage. It sees these volumes as disks and groups them into one or more aggregates. Aggregates provide storage to one or more volumes.

Several types of cloud disks are supported. You choose the disk type when creating volumes and the default disk size when you deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

TIP: The total amount of storage purchased from AWS or Azure is the _raw capacity_. The _usable capacity_ is less because approximately 12 to 14 percent is overhead that is reserved for Cloud Volumes ONTAP use. For example, if Cloud Manager creates a 500 GB aggregate, the usable capacity is 442.94 GB.

== AWS storage

In AWS, an aggregate can contain up to 6 disks that are all the same size. The maximum disk size is 16 TB.

The underlying EBS disk type can be either General Purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS SSD, Throughput Optimized HDD, or Cold HDD. You can also pair an EBS disk with Amazon S3 for link:concept_data_tiering.html[data tiering].

At a high level, the differences between EBS disk types are as follows:

* _General Purpose SSD_ disks balance cost and performance for a broad range of workloads. Performance is defined in terms of IOPS.

* _Provisioned IOPS SSD_ disks are for critical applications that require the highest performance at a higher cost.

* _Throughput Optimized HDD_ disks are for frequently accessed workloads that require fast and consistent throughput at a lower price.

* _Cold HDD_ disks are meant for backups, or infrequently accessed data, because the performance is very low. Like Throughput Optimized HDD disks, performance is defined in terms of throughput.

NOTE: Cold HDD disks are not supported with HA configurations and with data tiering.

For additional details about the use cases for these disks, refer to http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html[AWS Documentation: EBS Volume Types^].

== Azure storage

In Azure, an aggregate can contain up to 12 disks that are all the same size. The disk type and maximum disk size depends on whether you use a single node system or an HA pair:

Single node systems::
Single node systems can use three types of Azure Managed Disks:

* _Premium SSD Managed Disks_ provide high performance for I/O-intensive workloads at a higher cost.

* _Standard SSD Managed Disks_ provide consistent performance for workloads that require low IOPS.

* _Standard HDD Managed Disks_ are a good choice if you don't need high IOPS and want to reduce your costs.
+
Each managed disk type has a maximum disk size of 32 TB.
+
You can pair a managed disk with Azure Blob storage for link:concept_data_tiering.html[data tiering].

HA pairs::
HA pairs use Premium page blobs, which have a maximum disk size of 8 TB.
