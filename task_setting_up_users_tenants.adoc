Cloud Manager enables you to add additional Cloud Central users to Cloud Manager and to isolate working environments by using tenants.

== Adding users to Cloud Manager

If additional users need to use your Cloud Manager system, they must sign up for an account in NetApp Cloud Central. You can then add the users to Cloud Manager.

.Steps

. If the user does not yet have an account in NetApp Cloud Central, send them a link to your Cloud Manager system and have them sign up.
+
Wait until the user confirms that they have signed up for an account.

. In Cloud Manager, click the user icon and then click *View Users*.

. Click *New User*.

. Enter the email address associated with the user account, select a role, and click *Add*.

.What's next?

Inform the user that they can now log in to the Cloud Manager system.

== Creating tenants

Tenants enable you to isolate your working environments into separate groups. You create one or more working environments within a tenant. link:concept_storage_management.html#storage-isolation-using-tenants[Learn more about tenants].
